                Nobody should have the power to take credit for your creative
                work, diverting its value away from you. Ambr is the only way to
                send files, simultaneously placing you, the creator, in
                unparalleled control of the work you&apos;re sharing. Every
                shared file through Ambr is equipped with a tamper-proof,
                time-stamped digital fingerprint of your work, along with who
                you shared it with, all securely tied to you. Ambr strengthens

                Ambr is made for creatives to share their work with confidence.
                This could be passing around working files with clients, but it

                your email address, and the second is the unique link you click
                on from your email inbox.

                Re-uploading a file also acts as verification thatb your file

Five years ago, I found myself nervously sat on a train, en route to what would become a pivotal moment in my career as a young female graphic designer in the creative industry. My destination held the promise of my first pitch to a potential client, representing the agency I worked for at the time. The core of my mission was simple: to present my brainchild, a marketing campaign based around an idea with a unique take in a traditionally quite conservative and, dare I say, downright dull B2B sector. This endeavour wasn't just about generating revenue for the agency; it was about carving a path for my own professional growth and secure recognition from my managers as a creative thinker with valuable ideas. I walked into that meeting room greeted by handshakes and smiles, and as they turned into laughter and excitement while my team presented the idea, I felt my nerves melt away into optimism as I looked forward to a promising future.

A week later, however, the wind would be taken out of my sails as the company’s CEO gave us the news: “We thought you were great. Loved your enthusiasm! Unfortunately, this other agency just had better numbers, and I’m just a geek for numbers. All the best!”

“That’s that, then.” I thought, immediately humbled. I brushed myself off and accepted consolatory pats on the back by colleagues, silently vowing to not beg for pitch work again until my shattered confidence recovered. Maybe I just wasn’t ready yet. Maybe I’m not as good as I thought I was. Maybe I’d try again in a few years.

Six months went by. I walked into my office as usual, oblivious to the chattering in the air of a particular circulating news headline. International news of a marketing campaign that was uncannily similar to the one I had proposed six months prior. As I delved into the details, I discovered it wasn't just mere resemblance; it was an exact match. And the man spearheading the campaign was none other than the number-loving CEO with the extra wide grin I'd shaken hands with during my pitch. Confusion gripped me until a colleague who had been on the pitch team with me exclaimed, "Not again?!".

“What do you mean, not again?!” I asked, as we frantically scrolled through news article after news article about how smart, innovative and funny this campaign was. I never thought there would be an instance in my life where I would feel proud, validated and yet furious and betrayed at the same time.

“It’s the second time a client stole our pitch!” she exclaimed. “It happened to me a few years ago at my last agency, I can’t believe this is happening again.”

In that split second, I realised that this wasn't an isolated coincidence at all, but in fact a recurring pattern in the creative industry. My intellectual property, my creation carrying my copyright, was stolen, catapulting someone else into the spotlight, reaping the rewards that should have been rightfully mine and my team’s. Disbelief transformed into righteous indignation. Naturally, I wanted those responsible to be held accountable.

In part due to a combination of my early experience, and the agency's subsequent hesitance to fully support my cause, the disheartening chorus of “take it as a compliment” and "just let it go" reverberating throughout the industry left me in no position to do anything at the time.

It became abundantly clear that brushing off the theft of intellectual labor as flattery was a notion not only incompatible with my own deeply-rooted values but an entire industry continually striving for equitable recognition and compensation. While taking the path of least resistance might seem appealing at first, it corrodes the very essence of mine and others’ creativity over time. This corrosion devalues not only the creators but also the agencies they represent. When, as creatives, we deal in making money from intangible assets—our ideas and work—it is a loss none of us can afford, and a disservice to emerging talents.

Whether you are a lone creator or part of a larger agency, securing the value of your creations is imperative. In an industry where control over intellectual property is elusive, solidarity is absolutely the long-term answer we should work towards. We need clear standards of practice across the industry, instilling a culture that acts as a deterrent and clear guidelines on consequences, when theft occurs.

In the agency I was working for at the time, unbeknownst to me, there were already procedures, including a third-party pitch protection service in place, but nobody remembered or even seemed interested in using them for the intended use of protecting me—just a “pander token” for the creative’s working under them. Furthermore, the applicability of third-party pitch protection in the reality of the working life of a creative, their cost and inconvenience outside our normal daily workflow makes it unviable.

If I were working for an agency today, I would broach the subject of IP theft with a head of department. For my own sake, I’d want to be aware of the appetite to have my back. The response will say a lot about the agency you’re giving your valuable time and effort to. Unfortunately, the fact is that, as a young creative, fresh to the industry, it will likely feel implausibly daunting to ask such questions, especially if it’s during the interview before you even join.

This is where making a difference to what you do as an individual, in your own daily workflow, is where the most impactful step to ensure your work’s value is captured and not lost. The technology now exists for you to irrefutably prove ownership and secure the value from your work as you create and share it—without the previous requirement for 3rd-parties. For example, if we want to get paid, sending files is an unavoidable daily ritual in the creative industry. Sharing via Dropbox, WeTransfer, or any other, is as good as flinging your hard work into the oblivion; because after the fact, there is no strong evidence of the event, the IP, or proof of origin back to the creator.

I saw this as my opportunity to manifest a response, born from my own negative experience of theft, that I envision to be a symbol we can rally around. This is the very reason why I designed and built Ambr— a tool you can utilise right now. It functions just like any other file-sharing utility, while discreetly creating an immutable record of your work and the sharing event in the background. This record is inextricably linked to you, providing irrefutable evidence of your creative ownership whenever necessary. This approach not only saves you time and money but also eliminates the reliance on third parties.

As creatives, we don’t want to be bogged-down in worries our work will be stolen, we just want to create and do our best work. I created Ambr to give others the evidence I didn’t have, and to fill the gap while solidarity across the industry lags. It’s a practical step that we can all take today towards garnering an industry culture that values your creative ownership, rather than disregarding it. Sadly, as and many others have learnt the hard way, if you’re not capturing the value from your work, someone else will.

Ambr isn’t where my commitment ends, this is simply one example of a tool we can use today that automatically provides the level of working standards your hard work demands, placing the power firmly in the creator’s control. I want to open a dialog with you and the wider creative community to suggest other tools like Ambr we can add to our arsenal, and collectively decide upon which best practices we can enact today to improve the “client x creative” working relationship. If this has resonated with you, I’d love for you to introduce yourself, and leave a comment down below.

Thanks for reading, share your work fearlessly.
